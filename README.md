# predicting-2024-nfl-draft
The Jupyter Notebook and csv files used to predict the 2024 nfl draft. All statistical data was obtained from Pro Football Focus. The list of ranked prospects was from The 33rd Team.
Cleaned up the data by omitting non-starters, low value positions such as tight ends and special teams, specific season stats for players when they were injured, and 2020 due to COVID skewing the stats. Used a multiple linear regression to predict prospects NFL stats based on their college stats and used a formula for each position to determine how successful a prospect would be in the NFL. Only the first round of the NFL draft was predicted. The first prediction details the NFL draft order right before the draft, the second prediction updates the draft order to reflect draft day trades.
